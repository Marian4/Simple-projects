Simple projects that I made while studying JavaScript

# Form Validation

A simple form validation that verifies if the name, email and message requested by the form comply with the rules. No space can be left empty, a message will appear on the screen if the user forgets to fill in a field or doesn't do it for some reason. I also created a regex to check the email.

# Calculator

It has addition, subtraction, multiplication and division functions. There are buttons to set the values in the input, and it can't be done by writing directly in the field. the calculator starts with the value 0, when the user set a number, the zero is replaced, but if it was a point, it just concatenates with the zero. If the user clicks in on operation button and then on another one, the first one will be replaced (example: 3x4/, and then clicks on the + button, it becomes 3x4+). When the user clicks on the result button, if there was an operation as the last character of the expression, the last operation will be ignored and deleted. The calculator follows the right order when calculating the expression, first multiplication and division, after that, addition and subtraction. The result appears in the input field, that can be called visor. There also is a button to clear the input, the CE function.
