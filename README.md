# Form Validation

A simple form validation that verifies if the name, email and message requested by the form comply with the rules. No space can be left empty, a message will appear on the screen if the user forgets to fill in a field or doesn't do it for some reason. I also created a regex to check the email.

# Stopwatch

It only has basic functions, like start couting time, stop, and resete.
